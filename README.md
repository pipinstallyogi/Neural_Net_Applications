Single_perceptron : This model is made using Mnist data which can easily be imported in keras. This model is trained to tell us whether a given image is a 6 or not. If it is a six it shows 1 as output else 0. 

Multi_layer_perceptron : This model is able to detect the label for any image ranging from 0-9. This model is trained using Mnist data which is easily available.
